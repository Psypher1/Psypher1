## Hi, I'm James

I love languages. Put simply; J'aime les langues; –Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —è–∑—ã–∫–∏.

For me, each day is an opportunity to learn and try to be better than I was yesterday.
I believe knowledge is meant to be shared - I aim to do that wherever I can.

Collaboration is key - if you have anything you may want help with, please feel free to send me an email: [Email me](jamesmidzi@gmail.com)

## What I do:

**I tame snakes**

```py
def greet():
    print("Hello there")

greet()
```

**I talk to APIs**

```js
async function getServerSideProps(){
    const res = await fetch(process.env.API_URL);
    const data = await res.json();

    return {
        props{
            data;
          }
       }
    }
```

#### I create cool things with the stacks I know\*\*

```py
django-admin startproject my-new-site
```

```js
npx create-next-app my-site
```
