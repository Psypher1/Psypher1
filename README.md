### Hi, I'm James

I love languages. Put simply; J'aime les langues; –Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —è–∑—ã–∫–∏.

For me, each day is an opportunity to learn and try to be better than I was yesterday.
I believe knowledge is meant to be shared - I aim to do that wherever I can.

## I develop, I write, I tutor...

- I am currently a member of the [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/) Mentorship program
- I am workig towards inner peace üêº
